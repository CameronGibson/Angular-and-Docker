# ImageDock

This project is intended to be a dockerized CRUD application for transacting images to and from a database. Please view the Dockerfile for image build configuration.



TODO:

- Create and add a container of this image to a network. 

- Add MongoDB to the container network or implement AWS Lambda which will probably require Fargate and ECS.

- If AWS Lambda was not chosen, add a container of an ASP.NET image.
