# ImageDocker

This project is intended to be a simple dockerized Angular 11 application which processes images(Sprites) into a spritesheet. This spritesheet builder will be able to work with sprites of various sizes by finding the largest image and appending the difference in size with an alpha layer.

This project is containerized via Docker and will be pushed to Docker Hub once completed.
